# chromatic-index
Take the input of the number of vertices ‘n’ and number of edges ‘e’.
   Take the input of ‘e’ vertex pairs for the ‘e’ edges in the graph in edge[][].
   Function ChromaticIndex(), Color the graph edges:
   A) assign color to current edge as c.
   B) If any of the adjacent edges have the same color then discard this color and go to flag again and try with next color.
   C) Print the chromatic index of the cyclic graph.
   Print the color of each edge
